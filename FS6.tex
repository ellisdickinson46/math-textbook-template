        \item The \textbf{null} and \textbf{alternative hypotheses} generally take the following form:        \\

        \item The $\chi^2$ family of distributions can b used to approximate $X^2$ as long as none of the expected values is below 5.

        \item When using chi-squared tests, if any of the expected values are less than 5, then you have to combine frequencies in the data table until they are greater than 5.
        \item When selecting which of the $\chi^2$ family to use as an approximation for $X^2$, you have to select the distribution which has $v$ equal to the number of degrees of freedom of your expected values.
        \item If $X^2$ exceeds the critical value, it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is correct so you reject it in favour of the alternative hypothesis.

\lesson{Goodness of Fit}


\begin{mybox2}[colbacktitle=WildStrawberry]{Summary}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0.5\baselineskip}%
    \textbf{Goodness of fit} is concerned with measuring how well an observed frequency distribution fits to a known distribution.
    
    Suppose you take a dice and throw it 120 times. You might get results like these:
    \begin{center}\vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.8\linewidth}
        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|*6{P{11mm}|}}
            \hline
            \textbf{Number on dice, n}          & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6             \\\hline
            \textbf{Observed frequency ($O_i$)} & 23 & 15 & 25 & 18 & 21 & 18       \\\hline
        \end{tabularx}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{center}
    
    If the dice is \textit{unbiased} you would, in theory, expect each of the numbers 1 to 6 to appear the same number of times.
    
    For 120 throws the expected frequencies would each be:
    
    \hspace{1cm} $P(X=x) \times 120 = \dfrac{1}{6} \times 120 = 20$
    
    You would expect results like these:
    
    \begin{center}\vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.8\linewidth}
        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|*6{P{11mm}|}}
            \hline
            \textbf{Number on dice, n}          & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4  & 5  & 6        \\\hline
            \textbf{Observed frequency ($O_i$)} & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20       \\\hline
        \end{tabularx}
        \vspace{4mm}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{center}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \bfseries
        \item H\textsubscript{0}: There is no difference between the observed and the theoretical distribution.
        \item H\textsubscript{1}: There is a difference between the observed and the theoretical distribution.
    \end{itemize}
    
    In order to tell how closely the model fits the observed results you need to have a measure of the \\\textbf{goodness of fit} between the observed frequencies and the expected frequencies.
    
    The results and the expected frequencies are:
    
    \begin{center}\vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.8\linewidth}

            \textbf{Number on dice, n}          & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4  & 5  & 6        \\\hline
            \textbf{Observed frequency ($O_i$)} & 23 & 15 & 25 & 18 & 21 & 18       \\\hline
            \textbf{Observed frequency ($O_i$)} & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20       \\\hline
        \end{tabularx}
        \vspace{4mm}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{center}
    
    
    \textbf{The measure of goodness of fit is:}
